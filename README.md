Stupid little script that jiggles your mouse, type some things, browses the web and googles things so you look busy.

You can rename all the files and add more typing files and add as many search terms and urls you like. Edit the script make it do more stuff. 
Be sure to edit the ini file to reflect any changes you have made. Make sure the script and files are all in the same directory. This script runs
great as an PE just use pyinstaller with the one file command and you will have a PE you can carry around.
